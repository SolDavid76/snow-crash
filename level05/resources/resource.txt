We get a mail in '/var/mail'

echo /var/mail/level05
it shows us that there seem to be a crontab running '/usr/sbin/openarenaserver' every 2 mn

echo /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
The script executes everything in /opt/openarenaserver then deletes it.

We put a script that executes getflag in the dir

we wait max 2mn.
